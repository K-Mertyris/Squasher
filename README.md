# Squasher
"Light" Python program to read a file, put it into a dataframe, compare column headers and put data in a specific order.

## Goals

The purpose of this repo is to do some straightforward Python development. The goals of this app are as follows:

- Read a file
- Pull column headers from the file
- Compare column headers from file against a standard column header file
- Order columns according to the standard column header file
- Reorganize data into the correct columns and column order
- Save data as a pipe-delimited .csv file

## Additional Work

Section captures future work to be done.

- A true readme file
- Ability for user to select:
  - Standard column header file
  - Order of column headers
  - File to compare and load
  - Multiple files checked against a single header file
  - Multiple files checked against multiple header files
